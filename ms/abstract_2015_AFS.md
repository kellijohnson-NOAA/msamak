### Abstract
Multispecies stock assessment frameworks that use standard statistical tools,
are fit to the same data as their single-species counterparts, and can implement
a single-species model as a special case are rapidly developing and may signify
the path of least resistance towards an ecosystem approach to fisheries management.
Nevertheless, the transition from a single-species to a multispecies framework faces
many obstacles including but not limited to:
a) increased data requirements,
b) increased uncertainty in model output,
c) decreased transparency associated with their increasing complexity, and
d) a lack of methods for calculating management reference points.
Here we use Monte Carlo simulation to quantify the effect of changing
pre-specified weightings of compositional data on parameter estimates from a
multispecies statistical catch-at-age stock assessment model.
The multispecies model was fit to diet-compositions, which are often numerous and
highly variable, as well as traditional length- and age-compositions. Weighting
of diet-compositions, used to calculate relationships between predators
and their prey, can magnify changes in parameter estimates compared
to the outcomes from weighting traditional length- and age-compositions.
Adjusting weights had the largest impact on estimates of recruitment.
This work should be of interest to both stock assessment scientists and
fisheries managers given that biased estimates of recruitment can lead to
ill-informed management reference points.
